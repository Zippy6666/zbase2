# CHANGES
## The old weapon system has been wiped
### PROS
- Much better performance.
- The base now relies fully on engine weapon behavior, this is more ideal than my old fuckass system.
### CONS
- Some old NPCs are broken after the update. Hope the devs fix them.
- Some features, such as minimum fire distance, max shooters option, etc, are gone.
### PRO TIP
If the NPCs fire to little, turn off the squad option in the ZBase settings menu. If you still prefer intelligent squad behavior, use the dynamic npc squad addon thingy recommended in the ZBase pop-up menu you get when you start your game.
## Changed how melee weapons work
After the removal of the old weapon system that shit broke entirely. 
I instead made a new system so that any NPC (zbase or nah) can use ZBase melee weapons.
# FIXES
- Fixed client ragdolls still spawning when the NPC was gibbed
- Removed old net message that could be exploited to lag tf out of the server.
- Made the light quality slider actually functional.
- DOG NPC less retarded jumping.
# IMPROVEMENTS

- Controller can now fire past NPCs maximum weapon range
- Controller no longer displays some player hud elements
# IDONTREMEMBER
