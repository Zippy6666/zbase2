TODO
* May or may not be updated

- Controller follows crosshair more accurately (use relationships)
- System for restricting aim angle of range attacks
- Anim event on reload if necessary
- Quality sliders for dynamic light and particle effects
- Ensure face when doing anim works as intended, make other ideal yaw face calls cancel built in face (maybe)
- Fix holdtype bug / reload melee bug
